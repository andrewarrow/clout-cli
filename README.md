Welcome to the [cloutcli](https://bitclout.com/u/cloutcli) project.

[7 Minute Video Talk About This Project](https://vimeo.com/559521458)

There WAS a [bounty](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67661276/how-do-i-properly-sign-a-bitclout-tx-in-golang-vs-typescript) for how to fix our tx signing to not need javascript. It was claimed by https://stackoverflow.com/users/589259/maarten-bodewes thanks!

To understand the code start with the big if else in main.go for each menu option. Many things are still in the package `main` but slowly moving into various packages.

[they own your coin](https://andrewarrow.substack.com/p/they-own-your-coin) is a blog article I wrote about bc in general.

# Entering your secret words

Everything cloutcli stores on your local drive it stores in `~/clout-cli-data` so when you want to remove everything just run:

```
$ rm -rf ~/clout-cli-data
```

And any secret you entered has been deleted.

# You can login with multiple accounts

```
$ ./clout login
~/clout-cli $ ./clout login
Enter mnenomic: lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit aenean ac mauris sit
Secret stored at: /Users/andrewarrow/clout-cli-data/secrets.txt

$ ./clout login
~/clout-cli $ ./clout login
Enter mnenomic: these are twelve different words from the words above this line done
Secret stored at: /Users/andrewarrow/clout-cli-data/secrets.txt
```

Each time you login the words are appened to that `secrets.txt` file.

```
$ ./clout accounts

andrewarrow
cloutcli

To select account, run `clout account [username]`
```

When I run the `accounts` command I see all my logged in accounts.

# Backup

`export CLOUT_PHRASE='these are some nice words and stuff.'`

If you set a `CLOUT_PHRASE` you can run `./clout backup` to
place your secrets.txt file with ALL your words into a encrypted file
that can only be read with your CLOUT_PHRASE.

Backup this one file, and it can get you into all your accounts.


# Building

If you don't have gcc installed [install it first](https://www.guru99.com/c-gcc-install.html).

Then run `go mod vendor` and then `go build`

See this [blog post](https://andrewarrow.substack.com/p/how-to-clone-build-and-run-clout).
